# Country Rules Library v2.1 - Final Changes

## Summary of All Improvements

Version 2.1 incorporates comprehensive refinements based on real-world TP compliance scenarios.

---

## NEW IN v2.1

### 1. **"Integrated" Applicability** ⭐ NEW

**Problem:** Some countries require MF content but embedded in another document (not standalone).

**Solution:** Added "Integrated" to APPLICABILITY dropdown.

**Applicability Values Now:**
- Always
- Conditional
- **Integrated** ← NEW
- Never Required
- N/A

**Example: Malaysia**
```
Applicability: Integrated
Integrated With: Local File
Rule Notes: MF content integrated into LF per 2023 TPD; no standalone MF.
              Group revenue below MYR 3B threshold for standalone MF.
```

---

### 2. **INTEGRATED WITH Column** ⭐ NEW

**Purpose:** Specify WHERE MF content is embedded.

**Column:** C (new column after Applicability)

**Allowed Values:**
- Local File
- TP Form
- Other

**Rules:**
- Must be populated if Applicability = "Integrated"
- Should be blank if Applicability ≠ "Integrated"

**Examples:**
```
Malaysia:
  Applicability: Integrated
  Integrated With: Local File

Singapore:
  Applicability: Integrated
  Integrated With: Local File
```

---

### 3. **EFFECTIVE FROM (FY) Column** ⭐ NEW

**Purpose:** Track when rules came into effect or changed.

**Column:** D (new column)

**Format:** FY2024, FY2023, 2024, etc.

**Use Case:** Rule changes over time

**Example: France Threshold Change**
```
Entry 1:
  Country: France
  Effective From (FY): FY2023
  Threshold: 50000000 EUR
  Notes: Old threshold before 2024 update

Entry 2:
  Country: France
  Effective From (FY): FY2024
  Threshold: 45000000 EUR
  Notes: New threshold from FY2024
```

**Benefit:** Maintains historical rules without overwriting.

---

### 4. **SUBMISSION CHANNEL Column** ⭐ NEW

**Purpose:** How MF content is actually submitted.

**Column:** R (new column after Upon Request Days)

**Examples:**
- e-filing portal
- Form 275.MF
- Attachment with CIT
- Paper
- IRAS e-portal

**Clarification vs. TP Forms Sheet:**
- **Submission Channel (this column):** HOW MF content is transmitted
- **TP Forms Sheet:** SEPARATE forms/schedules that reference MF

**Belgium Example:**
```
MF Requirements Sheet:
  Submission Channel: e-filing portal

TP Forms Sheet:
  Form 275.MF: Summary form WITH MF data points (separate filing)
```

**Both exist:** Full MF report submitted via portal, plus Form 275.MF filed separately.

---

### 5. **Standardized Date Rule Dropdowns** ⭐ IMPROVED

**Columns Affected:**
- Prep Date Rule (Column M)
- Submission Date Rule (Column O)

**Standardized Values (enforced via data validation):**
- None
- CIT Date
- FYE-Based
- Fixed
- Upon Request
- With Tax Return

**Benefit:** Prevents typos, ensures consistency for logic engine.

---

### 6. **Data Validation** ⭐ NEW

**Enforced Validations:**

| Column | Validation Type | Values/Rules |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Applicability | Dropdown | Always, Conditional, Integrated, Never Required, N/A |
| Integrated With | Dropdown | Local File, TP Form, Other |
| Group Logic | Dropdown | OR, AND |
| Operator | Dropdown | >=, >, =, <, <= |
| Prep Date Rule | Dropdown | None, CIT Date, FYE-Based, Fixed, Upon Request, With Tax Return |
| Submission Date Rule | Dropdown | None, CIT Date, FYE-Based, Fixed, Upon Request, With Tax Return |
| Upon Request Days | Numeric | Must be positive whole number (> 0) |

---

### 7. **Validation Rules Sheet** ⭐ NEW

**New Sheet:** "Validation Rules" (first sheet)

**Contains:**
- Automatic validation rules (enforced by Excel)
- Manual integrity checks (user responsibility)
- Common patterns and examples
- Known issues and workarounds
- Data quality checklist

**Purpose:** Comprehensive guide for maintaining data quality.

---

## INTEGRITY RULES (Manual Checks)

Users should validate these (not auto-enforced):

### Rule 1: Integrated Applicability
```
IF Applicability = "Integrated"
THEN:
  - Integrated With must not be blank
  - Rule ID, Thresholds should be blank (no separate thresholds)
  - Notes should explain integration
```

### Rule 2: Upon Request Validation
```
IF Submission Date Rule = "Upon Request"
THEN:
  - Upon Request Days should be numeric (e.g., 30, 14, 10)
  - Can be blank only if genuinely unknown
```

### Rule 3: Multi-Condition Rules
```
For combined conditions (Revenue OR Employees):
  - Use SAME Rule ID across all rows
  - INCREMENT Condition Group (1, 2, 3...)
  - Set Group Logic consistently (OR or AND)
```

---

## EXAMPLES IN v2.1

### Example 1: Germany (Conditional with Multiple Thresholds)
```
Row 1:
  Country: Germany
  Applicability: Conditional
  Effective From (FY): FY2024
  Rule ID: MF-DE-1
  Condition Group: 1
  Group Logic: OR
  Metric: Revenue
  Scope: Group (Consolidated)
  Threshold: 750000000 EUR
  Prep Date Rule: None
  Submission Date Rule: Upon Request
  Upon Request Days: 30
  Submission Channel: e-filing portal

Row 2:
  Country: Germany
  Applicability: Conditional
  Effective From (FY): FY2024
  Rule ID: MF-DE-1
  Condition Group: 2
  Group Logic: OR
  Metric: Revenue
  Scope: Local Entity
  Threshold: 100000000 EUR
  (same deadlines as Row 1)
```

### Example 2: Malaysia (Integrated)
```
Country: Malaysia
Applicability: Integrated
Integrated With: Local File
Effective From (FY): FY2023
Rule ID: (blank - no separate thresholds)
Prep Date Rule: CIT Date
Prep Date Details: Prepare with CTPD by CIT filing (7 months after FYE)
Submission Date Rule: Upon Request
Upon Request Days: 14
Submission Channel: e-filing portal
Rule Notes: MF content integrated into LF per 2023 TPD; no standalone MF.
            Group revenue below MYR 3B threshold.
```

### Example 3: Singapore (Integrated)
```
Country: Singapore
Applicability: Integrated
Integrated With: Local File
Effective From (FY): FY2019
Rule ID: (blank)
Prep Date Rule: CIT Date
Submission Date Rule: Upon Request
Upon Request Days: 30
Submission Channel: IRAS e-portal
Rule Notes: MF elements included in LF per IRAS guidance.
            No standalone MF requirement.
```

### Example 4: Switzerland (Never Required)
```
Country: Switzerland
Applicability: Never Required
Integrated With: (blank)
Rule ID: (blank)
Thresholds: (all blank)
Rule Notes: No statutory MF requirement; TP documentation recommended
            for penalty protection
Deadline Notes: Documentation provided upon audit request (typically 30 days)
```

## KNOWN ISSUES & HOW TO HANDLE

### Issue 1: Currency Normalization
**Problem:** Thresholds in different currencies (EUR 750M vs MYR 3B)

**Solution:**
- Keep legal threshold in ORIGINAL currency in this sheet
- Client Data sheet converts everything to EUR
- Logic engine compares in common currency
- Preserves legal accuracy

### Issue 2: Mixed Metrics Per Country
**Problem:** Some countries combine Group revenue AND Local RPTs

**Solution:**
- Create separate Condition Groups
- Use AND logic between groups
- Example:
  ```
  Group 1: Revenue (Group) >= 500M  (AND)
  Group 2: RPTs (Local) > 10M       (OR)
  Group 3: Employees (Local) > 250  (OR)

  Logic: (Group 1) AND (Group 2 OR Group 3)
  ```

### Issue 3: Employee/Asset Metrics
**Problem:** Less common but valid thresholds

**Solution:**
- Set METRIC TYPE = "Employees" or "Balance Sheet"
- Set METRIC SCOPE = "Local Entity" or "Group"
- Client must provide this data
- Example: EU Directive IV thresholds (employees + assets)

### Issue 4: Rolling Updates
**Problem:** Thresholds change over time

**Solution:**
- Use EFFECTIVE FROM (FY) to track when rule took effect
- Keep multiple rows for same country if rules changed
- Example: France threshold updated in FY2024

### Issue 5: "Never Required" vs "N/A"
**Distinction:**
- **Never Required:** Country has no MF rule in law
- **N/A:** Regime doesn't apply in this context

**Example:**
```
Switzerland MF: "Never Required" (no law requiring it)
Small company CbCR: "N/A" (below threshold, not applicable)
```

### Issue 6: Submission Channel vs TP Forms
**Clarification:**
- **Submission Channel:** How MF content is transmitted
  - e-filing portal
  - Attachment with CIT
  - Paper submission

- **TP Forms Sheet:** Separate forms that accompany MF
  - Belgium Form 275.MF (summary form)
  - Spain Form 232 (TP return)
  - Italy RS 106 (disclosure)

**Both can exist:** Full MF report + separate summary form.
